# 📘 Skillspire Full-Stack Portfolio
### _Projects & Applications Built During the 2024 Skillspire Software Engineering Program_

This repository contains the full collection of projects, applications, and hands-on exercises I built while completing the **Skillspire Full-Stack Software Engineering Program** in 2025.

The course covered a wide range of technologies across the entire stack, including:

- **React, React Hooks, Context API**
- **Node.js & Express**
- **Flask (Python)**
- **MongoDB & PostgreSQL**
- **REST API design**
- **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Asynchronous JavaScript & Promises**
- **Deployment with Vite, Render, and Cloud platforms**

This repo demonstrates my ability to **learn new technologies quickly**, **build full-stack applications independently**, and **deliver complete features from concept to deployment**.

# 🌟 Featured Projects: 

## FullStackAssignment4 — Authenticated Message Board
_A full-stack MERN application with protected routes, user accounts, and CRUD messaging._

📁 **Path:** `Modules/Module 14 (MERN Full Stack)/FullStackAssignment4/`
🛠 **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Fetch API  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Auth:** JWT authentication + protected routes  

### 🔐 Overview
FullStackAssignment4 is a complete full-stack React application designed around real-world user flows:

#### ✔️ User Registration
Users can create an account with a unique username + password.

#### ✔️ Login & JWT Authentication
A backend-generated JSON Web Token is stored client-side and attached to authorized requests.

#### ✔️ Protected Routes
Only authenticated users may access the **Message Board**, which includes:

- Viewing all posts  
- Creating new posts  
- Editing their own posts  
- Deleting their own posts  

#### ✔️ Secure Backend
The Express API validates tokens on every protected route and rejects unauthorized calls.
